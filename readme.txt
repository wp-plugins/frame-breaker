Save your content from illegal use, break out of frames with Frame Breaker.


== Description == 

Iframes are great when it comes to embedding external content like youtube videos inside a webpage, but the same technique could be used to embedd a whole webpage inside a webpage.What that means is, if someone wants to embedd your website inside their website, they definitely can.

Some wicked webmasters do this to show pages from other websites inside a frame as if it's their own content.For example, a webpage with a toolbar on the top is actually a webpage inside a frame.That way the visitor never leaves the site using that frame, even if they are viewing content from your website.This is stealing, right? This adds seo benefits to the site using the frame, not the actual content owner.It also helps sell ads on their sites.

Frame Breaker plugin detects and breaks your site out of such frames, thus saving your content from illegal use and presenting your actual page to the visitor.Everbody happy, except that smart a$$. :)
